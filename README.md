# ticTacToe

I started this project by following a tutorial. Once I followed it I deleted everything to start over again.
I don't know how much js I will use for making the grid, but giving the previous projects I think I should.
even though the tutorial I followed did not.

4/19 - I deleted everything and am starting over.
4/25 - I deleted everything again. My tutor wrote most of the Code and I wanted to start over.
